      <p>"Christian Thomsen is a Danish artist born in Oxford, 93.
      He currently lives and works in Berlin, where he has a studio. His art is influenced by the nursery rhymes and childhood distractions growing up.<br> His bold, graphic compositions merge the old and the new, the familiar and the unknown, in a way that is both engaging and aesthetically striking.</p>

<p>Spending a significant amount of his younger years indoors either drawing reading or browsing online forums. This is reflected in his art, which often conveys a sense of nostalgia and escapism.<br>
Thomsen's recent series of paintings is an attempt to bridge the gap between the past and the present.<br> In these works, he blends references to popular culture with more traditional motifs, incorporating alchemical symbols and other elements of the supernatural into his compositions in a nonchalant and subtle way.</p>
<p>In addition to these themes, Thomsen is also drawn to the themes of love, growth, and connection. He often depicts intimate moments between lovers, bears holding hands, the delicate beauty of growing flowers, and the allure of moths drawn to the light.<br>Thomsen uses airbrush painting and oil to create works that are both dreamlike and grounded in reality, capturing the essence of these themes in a way that is both evocative and accessible." <br>
